<h1>Have you ever wanted a decent Dragon Ball Z release?</h1>
We got your back!
<p><a href="https://dombito.github.io/mergeproject/R1R2.pdf">We got your back!</a></p> There's literally no complete official release with this level of quality and respect to the viewer as this one.
It's there and it's for free.

That's right, it's legitmately a new complete release with unprecedented level of quality and detail, with no funimation bullshit such as:
- Low-IQ, destructive digital noise reduction and sharpening.
- Impact frames missing.
- Excessive cropping in arbitrary places.
- Automatic stabilizer filtering that destroys artistic footage shakings such as in-footage earthquakes.
- Compression artifact fest.
...And you don't have to pay $600 for it.


Of course, we spent hours working our asses off to make this.
After reading the document linked above and watching few of our episodes,
if you appreciate our work, want to give us a big special "thank you" and support this, past and possible future projects, you can do so by accessing this donation page, to know more and, of course, donate.
