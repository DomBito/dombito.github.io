<h1>Have you ever wanted a decent Dragon Ball Z release?</h1>
We got your back!
<p><a href="https://dombito.github.io/mergeproject/R1R2.pdf">We got your back!</a></p> There's literally no complete official release with this level of quality and respect to the viewer as this one.
<p>It's there and it's for free.</p>

<p>That's right, it's legitmately a new complete release with unprecedented level of quality and detail, with no funimation bullshit such as:<br>
- Low-IQ, destructive digital noise reduction and sharpening.<br>
- Impact frames missing.<br>
- Excessive cropping in arbitrary places.<br>
- Automatic stabilizer filtering that destroys artistic footage shakings such as in-footage earthquakes.<br>
- Compression artifact fest.<br>
...And you don't have to pay $600 for it.</p>

<p>Of course, we spent hours working our asses off to make this.
After reading the document linked above and watching few of our episodes,
